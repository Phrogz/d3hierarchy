  summary: Invoked for each element in the transition selection at the start of the transition, passed the current datum, index, and current (pre-transition) attribute value, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. This function must then return a _tween interpolator function_ to use during the transition; the interpolator will be passed parameterized time in the domain `[0,1]` and must return the desired attribute value.
