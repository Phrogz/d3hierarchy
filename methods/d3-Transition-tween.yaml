details: |
  Here is an example of a custom tween that interpolates the text between two strings with custom-rounded values:
  
  ~~~~
  .tween("text", function(d) {
    var last = this._lastData||0;
    var i = d3.interpolateRound(last, d);
    return function(t){
      this.textContent = "value: "+i(t);
    };
  })
  .each('end',function(d){ this.__lastData=d });

  summary: A unique name for this tween operation.
- name: tweenCalculator
  kind: js/Function
  summary: Invoked for each element in the transition selection at the start of the transition, passed the current datum, index, and current (pre-transition) attribute value, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. This function must then return a _tween interpolator function_ to use during the transition; the interpolator will be passed parameterized time in the domain `[0,1]` with the `this` context set to DOM element, and must do whatever is necessary to accomplish the tween.
