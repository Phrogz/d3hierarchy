    summary: This function is passed two data elements _a_ and _b_ to compare, and must return either a negative number, positive number, or zero. If negative, then _a_ should be before _b_; if positive, then _a_ should be after _b_; if zero, _a_ and _b_ are considered equal and the order is arbitrary.
